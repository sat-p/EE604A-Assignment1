%% PARAMETERS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

MEAN = 0;
VARIANCE = 1;
L = 4;          % Number of representation levels
MIN = -10;      % Guess for minimum of signal
MAX = 10;       % Guess for maximum of signal

%% Generating signal with required mean and variance %%%%%%%%%%%

std_dev = sqrt (VARIANCE);
pdf = @(x) normal (x, MEAN, VARIANCE);
